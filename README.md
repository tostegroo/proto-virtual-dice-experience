The minimum requirements to run are:

#### Windows

**Operating system:** Windows 7 64-bit or higher
**Processor:** Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster processors
**DirectX Version:** DirectX 11/DirectX 12

## Getting up and running

#### Windows

1. Install GitHub for Windows then fork and clone our repository. To use Git from the command line, see the Setting up Git and Fork a Repo articles.

    If you'd prefer not to use Git, you can get the source with the 'Download ZIP' button on the right. The built-in Windows zip utility will mark the contents of zip files downloaded from the Internet as unsafe to execute, so right-click the zip file and select 'Properties...' and 'Unblock' before decompressing it. Third-party zip utilities don't normally do this.

2. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). All desktop editions of Visual Studio 2019 and up can build UE5, including Visual Studio Community 2019, which is free for small teams and individual developers. Be sure to include C++ support as part of the install, which is disabled by default.

3. Run VirtualDiceExp.uproject to open the project.

#### Mac

1. Install GitHub for Mac then fork and clone our repository. To use Git from the Terminal, see the Setting up Git and Fork a Repo articles. If you'd rather not use Git, use the 'Download ZIP' button on the right to get the source directly.

2. Install the latest version of Xcode.

3. Run VirtualDiceExp.uproject to open the project.

## Build

To build the project you can use the platforms buttom on the right top menu in Unreal to pack the project for the desired platform.

Remember to install the SDK required for the desired platform.

# Additional Notes

The first time you start the enter project you may experience long load times. The project is optimizing content for your platform to the derived data cache, and it should only happen once.
